<p> "In our view, climate change will determine the destiny of mankind, so it is imperative that our generation 
makes the right choices" was the words that the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi used following the G20 meeting
in Osaka last month. In this meeting, these nations (excluding the USA, who have formally withdrawn from Paris accord
under Trump) agreed to strengthen upon the agreements made 
last year in Argentina towards Paris 2015 targets. The current target is limiting to a 2C rise of global mean surface temperatures compared to 
pre-industrial age levels. The consequences of a temperature rise above this limit are post-apolyptic. Our current trends (or Business
as Usual) show that we are going to exceed this limit around 2045 (and exceeding 1.5C around 2032). This corresponds to a greater
than 0.5m sea level rise (with ~145 million people living within 1m of mean high water with 70% in Asia, Anthoff et al. 2016), potentially 1/3rd of species being committed to extinction, 90% coral reef bleaching, decrease in 
production of crops, severe reductions in fresh water supplies and further committed irreversibal warming of the earth. </p>

<p> The first week of the four week "Transalpine" Climate-KIC Journey was designed to highlight the nature of the problem that 
climate change poses to humanity and planet earth. The Climate-KIC Journey is the world's largest summer school on climate innovation
and is a programme of the EU and European Institute of Technology. One of the questions debated during this week between us (the
majority of participants are students studying in the area of sustainability within European Institutions) was whether we can 
even solve climate change in the time we have. The climate change negotiation game was one of the activities that was used to 
highlight the urgency of the problem. Developed by Climate Interactive (<a href="https://croadsworldclimate.climateinteractive.org/">
https://croadsworldclimate.climateinteractive.org/</a>), in this game we played in teams representing
blocks of the world at the UN climate panel negotiations. Our group was assigned to represented the "Other developing world",
essentially developing countries excluding China and India (which were seperate blocks). Other blocks were the EU, USA and "Other
developed world". The aim is to reduce global warming to 2C by 2100 through emissions reduction pledges and agree on deals to 
share the costs of mitigation through the green climate fund to assist the most vulnerable nations. There are three rounds of 
negotiation with the model used to predict the temperature rise arising from the pledges made. </p>

<p> During the first and second round of negotiations, with blocks playing somewhat to character (Ahem USA), we managed to 
achieve a disappointing 2.7C increase by 2100. This involved time being given to the developing countries to prioritise economic and wellbeing 
development before starting to peak and plateau carbon emissions. We first agreed to reach peak emissions by 2055 with reductions
starting in 2065 with the rest of the world agreeing to peak between 2030 and 2055. A goal of 100 billion dollars was set as a target for the 
green climate fund to help assist the developing countries. Negotiations were feirce with "Other Developing" and the EU offering 
only 30 billion dollars with the USA imposing conditions on their pledge based on China and their commitments. </p>

<p> So what kind of reductions are required to hit the 1.5C degree target? The reality is that we should have been reducing 
emissions yesterday. Every day that emissions are not reduced, even more drastic reductions are required tomorrow. The graph below
shows the emissions trajectory required from the world with only China, India and the rest of the developing world allowed some 
leeway before having to start reducing emissions. </p>

<p> It was a bit sobering that even as a group of students who are relatively knowledgeable about climate change that
we failed to reach a deal resulting in a temperature increase of less than 2C. This was of course simulated in an 
environment without many of the political, historical, economic and social issues that accompany any discussions or negotiation
in actual climate change negotiations between nations.
