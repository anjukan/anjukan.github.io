This is my poster from the 2019 ESIPP Symposium "Investing in Our Energy Future". This is the first time that I am trying out embedding a QR code
in my actual poster with a link to this page and my website. I think posters in academia are generally a very inefficient way of transferring knowledge and capturing peoples
interest. This led me to try experiment a bit and using a QR code with a link to a webpage is my first iteration. I'd love to find out if you actually used the QR feature and your thoughts on if it 
is an effective method for posters

This poster is based on work that I plan to submit to the [SimBuild2020 Conference](https://www.ashrae.org/conferences/topical-conferences/2020-building-performance-analysis-conference-simbuild).
I shall upload the paper here as soon as I finish writing it!
