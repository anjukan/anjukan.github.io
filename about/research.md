Ireland has set a target for 40% of the country’s electricity to be produced from renewable energy sources 
in line with binding European Union directives. One of the key barriers to increasing the penetration of 
variable and intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power is the challenge of balancing 
supply and demand on the electricity grid. While these resources cannot be controlled in the same way as 
traditional fossil fuel based power plants, the need for managing this supply and demand mismatch has been 
increased from the demand side. Energy flexibility for buildings is of vital importance, given that buildings 
represent 40% of Europe’s energy end-consumption. The energy flexibility of a building is the ability to manage 
its demand and generation according to local climate conditions, user needs and energy network requirements. 
Commercial buildings are well suited to provide energy flexibility due to their inherent thermal inertia and use 
of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Other ways that modern buildings can provide energy 
flexibility is through the use of on-site generation such as photovoltaic panels, thermal energy storage, and 
electric storage such as batteries. The grid and building owners are interested in assessing the energy flexibility 
of a building or building portfolio for optimal provision of energy flexibility. Current approaches to assessing 
and utilising energy flexibility rely on first-principles based models that are time-consuming to building and 
rudimentary rule-based control strategies that lack predictive power. The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has 
resulted in a proliferation of buildings’ energy data and data-driven techniques, which have shown great potential in creating 
computational models for processes and plants where the cost of deriving first-principles based models is high. My 
research investigates the suitability and robustness of data-driven techniques to unlock the energy flexibility 
inherently available in buildings.
